## big things to implement:
1. back-end to convert markdown to html
2. system by which html documents get uploaded to site
3. file tree type organization system for these documents
   - similar to cat-v website
4. automation in typing markdown document on laptop and getting it uploaded to site 


i even got a little vim-based markdown previewer workin out
(here are some code snippets using it)

```java
public class MarkDown{
   public static void main(String[] args){
      System.out.println("hello world");
   }
}
// test are ytou working now?? yes!!!!
```

```c++
int main(){
   int *s = "hello";
   printf("the string is %s", s);
}
```

```python
def main():
   print("now some test python code")
```

right now i can either work on the backend conversion of markdown to html or i can keep hacking away at css and side navigator

the css sounds more annoying, but its the more pressing issue i think

i hate trying to make the side navigator go all the way down, endless trial and error

but its necessary

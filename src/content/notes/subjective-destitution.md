title: subjective-destitution

from reading ch 8 *lacan as a reader of hegel* from zizek's *less than nothing*. 

for context: here in an attempt to qualify my readings of lacan and kant offering a bridge, namely that the symbolization of trauma is its treatment (putting into language), and that one can expand language as a category of thought by means of poetry or science. 

analyst renounces all forcing of reality and, fully aware that the actual is already in itself rational, adopts the stance of a passive observer who does not intervene directly in the content, but merely manipulates the scene so that the content destroys itself when confronted with its own inconsistencies. 

"Hegelian wager is that the best way to destroy an enemy is to leave the field free for him to deploy his potential, so that his success will be his failure, since the lack of any external obstacle will confront him with the absolutely inherent obstacle of the inconsistency of his own position"

"Cunning is the great art of inducing others to be as they are in and for themselves, and to bring this out to the light of consciousness. consequently, a true master is at bottom only he who can provoke the other to transform himself through his act"

cunning of reason is not a trust in the power of reason (we can withdraw, reason will ensure that the good side wins), as a trust in the power of "unreason" in every determinate agent. this is not a faith in a secret guiding hand guaranteeing that the contingency of unreason will contribute to the harmony of Total Reason. no matter how well-planned things are, somehow they will go wrong. "a letter always reaches its destination": there is no repression without the return of the repressed, every totality-of-meaning is always disturbed by its symptom.

lacan asserts the identity between language and death. one has to "subjectivize one's own death" to recognize in it the only master to be obeyed. 

confront the truth, risk everything, ignore the consequences, and health will come *par surcroit*. confront the real and reality will take care of itself. do not compromise your desire, and your needs and demands will be provided for.

"When the participants in a conversation are confronted with Socrates, their words all of a sudden start to sound like quotes and cliches, like borrowed voices; the participants are confronted with the abyss of what authorizes them in their speech, and the moment they try to rely on the usual supports of authorization, authorization fails. it is as if an inaudible echo of irony adds itself to their speech, an echo which hollows out their words and their voice, and their voice appears as borrowed and expropriated"

the goal is for the analysand to assume the non-meaning of his speech, its nonsensical inconsistency, which implies, with regards to its own status, his *desubjectivization* or **subjective destitution**

*prosopopoeia*: a figure of speech in which an absent or imaginary person is represented as speaking or acting

when i speak it is never directly "myself" who speaks -- i have to have a recourse to fiction
-> all speech is indirect: "i love you" has the structure "my identity as lover is telling you that it loves you"

the "man without properties" has to be supplemented with properties without man, without a subject to whom they are attributed.

the only way for me to bring my subjective position of enunciation into words is to let myself be surprised by what i say, to experience my own words as a case of "it speaks in/through me"

"negation of negation": shift of perspective which turns failure into true success

"she knows there's no success like failure, and that failure's no success at all."

winston churchill said truth is not something we search for, but something upon which we accidentally stumble.

recognize when in the generalized babble of daily communication, a person stumbles upon truth (or rather, when the truth starts to talk in the babble). 

"in wartime, truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies"
winston churchill again

life, especially love, is warfare. lying is what keeps the world together. 

there's a difference between 
freud: truth revealed in slips of tongue, rupture in the flow of regular speech
hegel: truth arises from error through the self-sublation of error

freudian truth is partial and fragmentary, never a revealed totality. hegel is talking of absolute disclosure only formulated at the end of history

we enact reconciliation not by way of a miraculous healing of wounds, but recognizing the rose in the cross of the present. realizing that reconciliation is already accomplished in what we perceived as alienation.

underlying premise: the Whole is never whole, every notion of the Whole leaves something out, dialectical effort is to include this excess and account for it

no cunning of reason can retroactively justify present suffering

when Lacan writes "I, truth, speak" this does not mean the "big Other" in me speaks, but that the big Other's failure breaks through in my speech. 

a kiss is the answer to the question "what do you want?"

"the bible tells us to love our neighbors, and also to love our enemies; probably because they are generally the same people." - chesterton

the unconscious is not an underlying deeper force secretly governing what appear as contingencies, expressing itself through them: contingencies are irreducible, primary, they really are contingencies, and the unconscious is strictly parasitic, opportunistically exploiting unexpected contingencies to delivers its message. 

not "there is something in me more than myself running the show, so that I am not responsible for my acts". instead "i am responsible even for acts and decisions of which i am not aware"

the neuronal unconscious is merely not conscious, the Freudian unconscious is like the "undead", it is inherent to the psyche

the unconscious is not raw stuff to be "mediated", reflexively appropriated, by the subject, but the very site of this reflective inscription

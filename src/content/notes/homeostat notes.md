*the homeostat* - cybernetics and modern information systems


*March 1952, New York, NY*

"It may be a beautiful replica of something, but heaven knows what" - Julian Bigelow (p. 609)

"point" of a joke brings background into attention, touches a paradox briefly. circuit of contradictory notions is completed. quick diatribe on humor. 

Bateson makes the point that "laughter is the sign of agreement that X is both equal to Y and not equal to Y. it is agreement in a field in which paradox has been presented". this is effectively the ambiguity of language. puns are a simple supporting example, where its definition is that it takes advantage of the ambiguity of language. a more general claim that ive made in the past is that humor is a result of bringing something true to light. dating back to the idea that "the math problems of today will be the jokes of the future". the pretense is that those math problems will be common knowledge to the same extent that the ambiguity in a pun today is common knowledge. 

laughter should be a symptom of humility. a paradox whose solution is itself. moment of recognition, not left lost at an incompatibility, but able to see that they naturally fit. 

two things then:
1. humor as a sign of something true that is not well modeled by language
2. humor as a revealing of something true besides language. a man falling etc.
bateson was specifically studying the role of laughter in communication, as a special case of the central role of paradox in communication. paradox is the only viable way to discuss something that is not already stated in language. a good joke will bring the omitted center into attention. bateson specifically says "humor is only one of the situations that evoke laughter". then laughter is one the same level of generality as paradox in language, and humor is a special case that can invoke this. im reminded of watching shitty movies on acid, there's a warm empathetic recognition rather than a cold 

they had a discussion on modeling this kind of oscillating behavior of humor. 
"We should be able to say how we would construct a cybernetic machine of some kind which would show this characteristic which would be thrown into some sort of oscillating condition by certain types of contradiction."

similar idea to the medium becoming part of the message as music has developed. when something is too high fidelity is feels more alien and synthetic than if it had clear signs of tape distortion, poor mastering, low-fidelity recording etc. early ween is great in part because of the low-fidelity sound. communicates about communication i.e. we are a shitty rock band, this is what a rock band can communicate to its audience. 

claim: inter-species communication impossible precisely because the only common knowledge we share is the phenomenology of nature in its most bare sense. this is exactly what we struggle to capture in language and constitutes humor in the right setting. but we cannot laugh at each other's jokes since we dont have the same set of common knowledge as humans do. then the remarkable thing is that most humans share the same base of knowledge. now, if me and a crow had some shared sense of the world, we could build a language by paradox. mutual understanding of a truth that we are able to point out in a way that is mutually understood. in this sense, there is an aspect to humor that involves group identity. but at the very least, this group identity is primarily that of a species and a people rather than a political, cultural, or national one. what's great about being happy with a dog is that you see in each other a mysterious affection that makes no sense, and its a great joy.

one point of connection between this piece and ashby's: equilibrium and oscillation. 

the patient who says "I walked around the grounds this morning and I said 'I will be honest. I am going to get something straight.'" fairly certainly will not achieve much that day. advance depends more on his ability to say to himself "let me freely imagine what I want to imagine and see what comes up." 

therapy is a place where the freedom to admit paradox has been cultivated as a technique

an example of ambiguity/disconnect between logic and language: 
"if A, then B", the "then" in logic does not mean at a later time. "if ... then ..." in language does typically imply some temporality however. draw out explicitly the sequential contradiction in the electric buzzer. 

*lachschlag* -> "laughter seizure". form of cataplexy.

ashby: "if a system is composed of variables that often get locked constant, it tends to cut the system into functionally independent subsystems which can join and separate. instead of being a totally interlaced system with everything acting on everything else, it allows subsystems to have temporary independencies."







law of requisite variety: "a less complex system cannot regulate a more complex one"

**key question:  what discontinuities are there between the project of cybernetics in the 20th century, and the modern regime of information systems?**

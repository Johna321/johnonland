title: carpenter's gothic
draft: true
---

bleak, bare quality to the writing with the only reprieve being our 
protagonist Liz .

{ .. purple passage .. }

the narration when the camera is pointed at liz becomes phantasmagoric, 
entropic, as though melting into the scenery surrounding her. her quality 
is almost that of a still life painting.

*orson welles in jane eyre 1943, liz's hypnagogic narration at end of ch2*
- the moon ascending in solemn march ...
- a warm glow ...
- a demoniac laugh ...
- down a winding walk ...

"knees drawn up she pulled the towel round her bared shoulders .. staring at that page till she seized the pencil to draw it heavily through his still, sinewed  hands, hard irregular features, cool disinterested calm of his eyes and a bare moment's pause bearing down with the pencil on his hands, disjointed, rust spotted, his crumbled features dulled and worn as the **bill collector he might have been mistaken for**, the desolate loss in his eyes belying, belying, ... towel went to the floor in a heap and she was up naked, legs planted wide broached by scissors wielded murderously on the svreen where she dug past it for the **rag of a book its cover gone**, the first twenty odd pages gone in fact .. coming down with the pencil on **belying**, a *sense that he was still a part of all that he could have been*"

the **jack russell terriers** adored Billy when they were growing up in Longview. after he was 4 he put mud on Liz's doll's plates pretending to feed them, and one of the terriers **bit billy**. 

two primary pairs of foils: liz/billy and paul/mccanddless (?)

too many god damn pieces, got to fit em together. Liz? 

STILL LIFE i.e. DEAD NATURE -> mistook a pigeon for a rag, found it dead by the end of the chapter.

paul's sketch of complicated senator/ude/publicity scheme mistaken for a rendering of the battle of crecy (which is misspelled as "cressy")

ch. 5 mccandless mentions the [Piltdown fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piltdown_Man) , bone fragments *presented as fossilised human remains* (that were supposed to be the "missing link" between apes & humans) when in reality was altered mandible+teeth of orangutan combined with cranium of *fully-developed, yet small-brained* modern human. was used to espouse *eurocentric* model (early human evolution started in Britain not Afica)

arkansas town of Smackover was originally named Chemin-couvert

paul's fudging biblical quotes:
- mccanddless takes as ignorance (ephesians -> ephusians)
- 80.24 (carpenter's son part) hodgepodge of phrases from Bible and pseudo-biblical dictation 
  "the profit isaiah", "seekers after his absolute truth", "builded with simple carpenter's 
  tools from the humble materials closet to his hand his father's house, wherein are many mansions"


Fitz Hugh Ludlow - "Too Late"
>While we send for the napkin the soup gets cold,
>While the bonnet is trimming the face grows old,
>When we've matched our buttons the pattern is sold,
>And every thing comes too late--too late!

letter from thailand first mentioned in ch 2, but contents not revealed until end of ch 7. reveals that paul had a child with a thai woman, presumably during his time in the war? the child and mother are asking for money and guaranteed entry to the US.

steven moore frames that novel's central conflict as *revealed truth* vs *acquired knowledge*. nothing is revealed by a godlike omniscient narrator. "what really happens" learned by attention. 
*e.g.* regarding McCandless
$$
25\text{ y/o son } + \text{ Irene uses Tampax} \implies \text{married twice}
$$

this is communicating a frustration on the ambiguity of life by forcing the reader to come to their wits' end fitting the pieces together. in the same way paul is frustrated trying to put the pieces together. 

paul and the evangelicals are fitting the pieces together to *act*, to crusade, to exploit, to profit. liz too is haunted by a drive to resolve ambiguities: by means of intricate, ornate descriptions of every aspect in her environment or wisdom from a mysterious, educated older man with which she contemplates what could have been. at times it seems the only thing she can look forward to is talking with her childhood friend Edie, who might be able to reveal to her some secret she hadn't noticed in her past. manic cleaning, organizing, the locked room in the back who only the mysterious old man can open for her that she might peek inside and figure it out.

in this climax here, even defining etymologies and connotations of words, giving every last detail that might account for a protean emptiness, a *lack*, the *missing link*. 

and what's worst of all is that paul is the one who survives.

moore: "The carpenter of 'the profit Isaiah' and the carpenter's son of the gospels together have created a Gothic nightmare of blood, guilt, persecution, righteousness, and intolerance..."

speaks volumes as an account of achievement society in contemporary america: a culture of positive power that obliges a man of himself more than he has already given, *in perpetuity*. tantamount to a *lack* in every individual, one that needs to be accounted for, either by seeking or by exploitation 

< -- by the means of Paul or Liz.>

**review**.

carpenter's gothic is a really brooding book. there's a bleak, bare quality to the writing with Liz Booth being the only reprieve. nothing is ever revealed directly to the reader and what "really happens" is only given by paying close enough attention to infer. being aged 63 at the time of writing, it seems like this was a device for Gaddis to express his own struggle coming to terms with religion, capitalism, america, and all the other ambiguous things in life. communicating frustration on the ambiguity of life by forcing the reader to come to their wits' end trying to fit the pieces together.

"trying to tell you what I'm trying to do here, trying to put the pieces together your God damn brother in there pulling them apart"

"Try to, try to get all the God damn pieces together"

"He'd slumped back against word of two tractor trailer trucks overturned and on fire at an entrance to the George Washington bridge, -- fit the pieces together you see how all the God damn pieces fit together."

Paul and the evangelicals are fitting the pieces together to *act*, to crusade, to exploit, to profit. Liz, too, is haunted by a drive to resolve ambiguities: by means of intricate, ornate descriptions of every aspect in her environment or wisdom from a mysterious, educated older man with which she contemplates what could have been. at times it seems the only thing she can look forward to is talking with her childhood friend Edie, who might be able to reveal to her some secret she hadn't noticed in her past. manic cleaning, organizing, the locked room in the back who only the mysterious old man can open for her that she might peek inside and figure it out.

title: Building John on Land
---
In the past few years I've tried various different methods of organizing my work and thoughts. Bullet journals, e-ink tablets hooked up to cloud storage, &c. [vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) was great. It encouraged wiki-style webs of links, supported Markdown syntax, exported to HTML, and (most importantly) integrated well into my laptop's environment; but terminal displays don't allow the freedom of images, LaTeX renderings, embeddings, &c. I shall be free. 

## Criteria of the ideal personal knowledge system
1. Standardized syntax and format in entries
2. Support for links, backlinks, graph connections
3. Extensibility for non-text features (i.e. videos, equations, images)
4. Easily exportable to web
5. Freedom in design

Up to now, the best system I've found for this is [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) which is designed for integration with personal knowledge systems using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) or other [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/overview/)-supporting markdown systems. And so, the page you are viewing now is generated using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).

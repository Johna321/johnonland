This is the personal website of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">John Aitken</span>. Currently studying Computer Science and Biochemistry at the University of Florida in [Gainesville, FL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainesville,_Florida). 

<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">John on Land</span> was originally conceived as a blog website, but now it'll serve as a personal wiki made up of [[notes/|notes]], [[writings/|writings]], and [[projects/|projects]]. I'll also try to keep a running list of [[links]] to my favorite websites that have all, in some way or another, contributed to the making of this one.

Here's my [Github](https://github.com/Johna321) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/j-aitken/). You can download my [CV here](https://johnon.land/cv.pdf)
